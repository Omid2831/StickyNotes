    <p id="head2"> This explains how the first box works: when you hover over any box, it will swap places with the box in the opposite direction. For instance, hovering over the left box will cause it to move right, while the right box moves left. This creates an engaging and playful interaction.</p>

        Meet Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, who reigned from 559-530 BC1
        . Known for his vast conquests and progressive rule, Cyrus respected the customs and religions of the lands he conquered1
        . His legacy includes the famous Edict of Restoration, which allowed the Jewish people to return to their homeland1
        .
        
        By his side was Cassandane, his beloved queen2
        . Cassandane was known for her grace and wisdom, and her death in 538 BC was mourned throughout the empire2
        . She bore Cyrus several children, including Cambyses II, who succeeded him as king2
        .
        
        Together, they laid the foundations of one of history's greatest empires. üåç‚ú®</p>
